## Problem Statement
In a statement,

> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we understand the most correlated attributes and reasons for heart disease? can we also build an accessible and usable web app that allows users to key in their data and see if they have a risk of having a heart attack or not?


## Installation

```
Install pip requirements
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python app.py

## Data
This dataset was created by combining different datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features by IEEE scholars which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. The five datasets used for its curation are:

- Cleveland: 303 observations
- Hungarian: 294 observations
- Switzerland: 123 observations
- Long Beach VA: 200 observations
- Stalog (Heart) Data Set: 270 observations

The Dataset Can be accessed directly from IEEE Datasets. <br>
